Discrete Event Queueing Network Simulator
===============
* For the course "Computer Systems Performance" June 2013

This project simulates a queueing network.
The arrival of the requests follows a Poisson distribution. 
The system simulated is an open loop system of a CPU, 2 hard disks and an  exit waiting queue.
